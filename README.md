# SCSS Dashboard

SCSS Dashboard is a personal project created using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The project utilizes Vite to compile SCSS code into CSS. Please note that the dashboard is not designed to be responsive, as it is intended for personal use and will not be deployed in a production environment.
